In high school, I played the viola.  I was really good and practiced for about 2 hours every day.  After a lot of hard work, I became first chair in the orchestra.  The trips were a lot of fun.  We went to Germany and the Caribbean on a tour with an ensemble.  We played everything from Bach to what were then current hits like Queen.  The part that I liked the best was after the performances when we would go as a group out to the bars.  Drinking was allowed at 15 then.  We would go out and get German beers.  The girls really liked our American accents and thought that we were totally cool.  They showed us how to sneak into the art museums.  I still remember this one girl named Florette.  She snuck Joe and I into the first punk concert that I had ever seen.  It was awesome!  London Calling was the first song I heard – it’s still my favorite.
